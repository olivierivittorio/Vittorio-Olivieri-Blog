| General topic?               |  They discovered artificial muscles that could have more than one shape thank's to liquid crystal that can change it's form when cooled.                       |
| Procedure/what was examined? | They created an " Elastomer " that is made of liquid crystal it was the main thing studied. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  They find out that this elastomer was working very well and could be adapt to soft robots and soft machines      |
| Remaining questions?         | How the crystal liquid can change in the robot and how the rearrangement work ? |
