| General topic?               | They created a new kind of piston that use artificial muscles to work                |
| Procedure/what was examined? | They made a lot of test under low pressure and their ' piston tension ' is as efficient as usual one. Because they use FOAM material ( which is mainly material that looks like origami ) so when you lower the pressure the artificial muscles kinda shrivel up and lift something at the same time. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | They made a test that compare tension piston and regular piston at crushing objects. The piston tension was as good as the regular one but was working under lower pressure.      |
| Remaining questions?         | None |
